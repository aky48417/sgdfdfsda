	<p>Hey there! My name is Anjala Yadavalli, and I am a second-year Management Information Systems major at the University of Georgia. I am from Alpharetta, Georgia, and I am 19 years old. I am from India, and I moved to the United States when I was just 5 years old! I have lived in a small town in South Carolina, in Marietta, Georgia, and Alpharetta, Georgia. My family currently stays in Alpharetta, and I visit home every other weekend or so! My hobbies include watching a ton of TV, spending time with my family and friends, and playing with my puppy, Jack! I love reading, writing, and learning, so going to school is always exciting for me. I am in  my second year of school, so I am sad to see it come to an end soon. I also like to be productive, so I cannot wait to start working! I want to be a consultant and work for a big consulting agency in New  York, as that is my favorite city. I have been to New York three times, and I fall in love with it each time I go. Anyways, I will be talking about my school life, my home life, and some other fun facts about myself!

	<div><h3>Student</h3></div>
	<p>I started studying at the University of Georgia in Fall of 2016, and I got into the Terry College of Business in Fall of 2017. The Management Information Systems major at UGA is one of the top in the nation, and it is very tough to get into. I am excited yet nervous to start taking my major-level courses next year. On November 13, 2017, I registered for my class schedule for next semester, Spring 2018. I will start taking my business courses next semester, so it will be tough. I will be taking Principles of Management, Data Management and Analytics, Principles of Marketing, and Principles of Finance/>. I start my classes at 11AM on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and at 9AM on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I end by 2 PM at the latest, and I like that because I like to be done early. Here is a look at my schedule for next semester:</p>

<div><h3>Home Life</h3>
<p>My home life consists of me spending time with my family, including my year-old Shih-Tzu, Jack! He is so playful and adorable, and he is one of my favorite excuses to visit home often. Alongside Jack, I relaxing with my parents. My mom, Roopa Yadavalli, and my dad, Ravi Yadavalli, and I love watching movies and tv
shows together. Last summer, we watched a 170-episode periodical drama in one month. Our home is in Alpharetta, Georgia, and we love road-tripping across the country during breaks. For Thanksgiving 2017, we have planned to drive up to Detroit, Michigan for a family reunion. We have also roadtripped across the entire east coast 
one summer! <div>Some of the places we have traveled to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Portland, Maine</li>

<div><h3>Who is Anjala Yadavalli?</h3>
<p>As you may have picked up so far, I am very big on my family and school. Those are two elements of my life for which I feel very strongly. I strive to be the best version of myself, which includes being present
when I am with my family, always working hard, and envisioning my future as my primary driver. My favorite quote is <strong><q>She believed she could, so she did.</q></strong> This quote inspires me to be productive and make the most of my time. 
Whenever I feel unmotivated by school or life in general, I say this quote to myself, and it instantly clears my mind and reminds me of why I need to work hard. For my future, I want to have a stable and successful lifestyle, both personally
and professionally. In order to do so, I must work hard now to be able to enjoy later.</p>
<p>Additionally, some fun facts about me are that my favorite show is <i>Friends</i>, my favorite song is <i>Riptide</i> by Vance Joy, and I love pizza more than any other food in this world!</p>
<p style color=:pink">I hope you gained some insight into my life.</p>
